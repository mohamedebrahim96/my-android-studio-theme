# Making Android Studio pretty
Today, during a glorious transition from 1.5 rc1 to 1.5 Android Studio decided to keep all of my settings completely intact, with the honorable exception of GUI and syntax themes and LogCat colors, which were just gone. Being me, I had not the slightest recollection on how the previous combo have gotten into my editor and I had to search for everything again. Not particularly enjoying the process of rediscovery, I decided to keep it stashed somewhere, both for the future me and maybe for some curious souls that happen to bump onto my blog.
